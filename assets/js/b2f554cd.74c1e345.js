And now we finally are re-releasing it! It got new screenshots, videos and a better description!\\n\\n[![](/img/blog/2022-march/store-page.jpg)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1841660/nanos_world/)\\n\\n#### Please WISHLIST NOW!!!\\n\\n<iframe class=\\"steam-widget\\" src=\\"https://store.steampowered.com/widget/1841660/\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" width=\\"620\\" height=\\"190\\" loading=\\"lazy\\"></iframe>\\n\\nA downside of this whole situation is that the old store and the old game entry will be deactivated. Soonish everyone will receive a new Steam Key to activate the new nanos world in your library!\\n\\nAlso we embedded a tool to export (then import) your Achievements and Stats from the old game to the new one. You just need to launch the old game once before launching the new one and everything is imported automatically!\\n\\n\\n## Performance Optimization\\n\\nEveryone knows that one of the great aspects of nanos world is the performance and the optimization. And in the last month we had a significant advance in improving some internal critical points of our framework.\\n\\n\\n### Memory\\n\\nThe first one to mention was a **huge** improvement in the memory usage of our spawned entities.\\n\\nInternally, we use a special system to handle sending and syncing data through the network. Our approach is to have a similar system to Unreal\'s Replication system. But until then this system was responsible for most of part of the memory usage in each spawned Entity.\\n\\nWith that in mind we aimed to solve this problem, not to mention most of these memory usage was duplicated in all entities unnecessarily. And fortunately we succeeded on reducing up to 90% of the memory usage of the entities. Right now it occupies exactly the data which is strictly needed for it\'s existence!\\n\\nWe did a small test to compare, spawning 10.000 Characters through Scripting, check the memory usage difference:\\n\\nBefore:\\n![](/img/blog/2022-march/memory-before.png)\\n\\nAfter:\\n![](/img/blog/2022-march/memory-after.png)\\n\\nComparison of some Entities Memory Usage Before x After:\\n\\n| Entity | Memory Usage Before | Memory Usage After | Reduction |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| Cable | 5.4 KB | 1.1 KB | 80% |\\n| Character | 13.1 KB | 1.8 KB | **86%** |\\n| Light | 4.8 KB | 1.0 KB | 79% |\\n| Melee | 7.1 KB | 1.5 KB | 79% |\\n| Particle | 4.6 KB | 1.0 KB | 78% |\\n| Player | 3.1 KB | 0.3 KB | **90%** |\\n| Prop | 4.8 KB | 1.0 KB | 79% |\\n| StaticMesh | 4.5 KB | 1.0 KB | 78% |\\n| TextRender | 5.3 KB | 1.1 KB | 79% |\\n| Trigger | 4.0 KB | 0.8 KB | 80% |\\n| Vehicle | 7.9 KB | 2.0 KB | 75% |\\n| Weapon | 11.1 KB | 2.0 KB | **82%** |\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThis usage was calculated on Server side. On Client side the values would be a little bit bigger, not to mention to the Assets which are loaded together.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThis was achieved just by improving one single system, we didn\'t even start looking for active compression techniques or reducing some variables sizes which are unnecessarily bigger than it needs. \ud83d\ude4f\\n\\n\\n### Network\\n\\nAnother great optimization was in our network packets, each data sent through the network has a common \\"header\\" to identify some operations. This is a constant \\"cost\\" for the network which we managed to reduce up to 75% of it\'s size, making all data being sent through the network statically lower!\\n\\n\\n### Client Side\\n\\nWe started advancing into optimizing the game in the client side. Which normally is trickier than on Server side because it concerns to dealing to Unreal Engine subsystems. But we managed to add some optimizations based on the Quality Settings selected. For example on the Blood or Bullet Holes particles, now depending on the distance and on the Effects Quality selected, they will be less or not spawned at all.\\n\\nWe\'ve also tweaked the Vehicle System to do similar optimizations using this system. There is still a lot which we can improve! \ud83d\ude00\\n\\n\\n## New Class: [Blueprint](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/blueprint)\\n\\n![](/img/docs/blueprint.png)\\n\\nA very required class is being introduced: **Blueprint**! Now it is possible to spawn any Blueprint Actor in nanos world!\\n\\nWe\'ve managed to implement the method: `CallBlueprintEvent()` which you can create any **Event** or **Function** with any number of parameters in your Blueprint and call it from Scripting! This expands many possibilities!\\n\\nAlso, you can spawn it on server and it will follow the same rules as any other Actor Entity, and it will be synchronized with other players using the Network Authority system as well!\\n\\n\\n## New Class: [Database](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/database)\\n\\n![](/img/docs/db.png)\\n\\nSomething that is extremely fundamental for some game-modes such as roleplay is the Database. Until then we were providing a MySQL Module to be used as a third-party Lua library, but due it\'s complexity to integrate with your server and also because it wasn\'t possible to make async queries we dug into a more robust solution.\\n\\nFor that, we present the new class: [Database](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/database). A all-in-one solution for connecting to a database, it supports **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite** out of the box! Not to mention the async and thread-safe queries!\\n\\nCheck it\'s page for complete documentation and examples!\\n\\n\\n## Vehicles Tire Skid Mark\\n\\nA small but cool addition we did for vehicles was adding Tire marks when it skids:\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/2022-march/tire-skid.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nAlso, an awesome detail was added: the wheels get smeared with blood!\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/2022-march/tire-blood.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nIt is 100% dynamic and procedural!\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/2022-march/tire-blood-decal.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## Sandbox Improvements\\n\\nWe got several improvements regarding the sandbox game-mode! The first one is the sandbox \\"API\\": we listed all functions and events it exports so you can integrate your own entities/tools or use it\'s features.\\n\\nAlso we\'ve modularized the menu, categories and tabs, and you can add your own from your external package!\\n\\nCheck it out the sandbox API in the GitHub page: https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-sandbox.\\n\\nFinally, we\'ve improved our Physics Gun tool, now you can control it using the mouse and also have a \'snap-to-grid\' movement!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/2022-march/physics-gun.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nSeveral other adjustments and bug fixes were made on Sandbox as well.\\n\\n\\n## New [Particle Methods](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/particle)\\n\\nWe\'ve expanded the possibilities for Particles! Now it\'s possible to set Material parameters on it, and also use any **Texture**, **WebUI** and **Canvas** as parameters as well!\\n\\nFor example you can spawn a Canvas, draw on it and use as a Material Particle parameter!\\n\\nThe following video shows using the WebUI https://nanos.world as a Material parameter into the Particle! Rendering in runtime!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/2022-march/particles-webui.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## Notable Improvements\\n\\n### Music Concurrency\\n\\nWe finally managed to fix the Music problem, which was making Sounds of type Music from stopping when too many sounds were spawned.\\n\\n\\n### Client-side [Props](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/prop)\\n\\nProps can now be spawned on Client side as well! This allows having \\"unnetworked\\" dynamic meshes spawned on client, intended for use as visual effects and non-gameplay features.\\n\\nWe\'ve already updated the Sandbox\'s Destructable entities to use client-side debris!\\n\\n\\n### Level Static Meshes\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2022-march/been.jpg)\\n\\nNow all [StaticMeshActors](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Basics/Actors/StaticMeshActor/) from a Map are automatically loaded as [StaticMesh](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/static-mesh) entity on Client Side! It is possible to paint, destroy, move and everything else on them on client-side!\\n\\n\\n### Async Texture Loading\\n\\nWe\'ve improved our Client loading system and now textures (e.g. `.jpg`) are asynchronously loaded and the texture is applied in a deferred way. This system currently is implemented under `SetMaterialTextureParameter()` for testing, soon we can use it in other methods as well.\\n\\n\\n### Async [File](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/file) Loading\\n\\nIn addition to the above, we\'ve expanded our Async implementation into File class, which now have the `:ReadAsync()` method!\\n\\n\\n### New [Light](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/light) Methods\\n\\nWe\'ve added a bunch of missing Light setters and getters methods, also the ability to toggle it on/off with `SetVisibility()`.\\n\\n\\n### [Assets.toml](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/core-concepts/assets#assets-pack-configuration) Changes\\n\\nThe Asset.toml got a new category: `unreal`, where we must specify a new setting `unreal_version` (the unreal version this Asset Pack was compiled on), this will be an important feature to prevent old Assets versions from crashing the game.\\n\\nAlso it got the new `blueprints` category for listing Blueprints \ud83d\ude09.\\n\\n\\n### Vehicle Collisions\\n\\nWe\'ve tweaked and improved our Collision configurations and now Vehicles interact better when colliding with other objects, including Networked Characters, Props and other Vehicles.\\n\\nBefore other Networked Characters were desyncing when colliding with vehicles (they started to fly and weird things happened when objects hit the Vehicles wheels), and also the hit between two vehicles were extremely rigid, which has been fixed too and will be more organic now.\\n\\n\\n### Sun Improvements\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2022-march/sunrise.jpg)\\n\\nThe Default Sun light and shadows has been improved, specially during sunrise/sunset which we had some artifacts and shadows disappearing, now it must be smoother and prettier (and hopefully more efficient).\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThank you for another month of support! There were incredible advances with Blueprint and Database Classes, and also to finally lining up our Steam Page again!\\n\\nOur north is to continue advancing performance and memory optimizations, as well as bringing essential new features to nanos world!\\n\\nWe also have some important challenges of bringing distance based culling and dimensions system for entities, which is essential for creating special environments.\\n\\nThere are some essential Classes that we want to implement as well, like custom Characters (e.g. for Animals) and other types of Vehicles (Air, Sea).\\n\\nFinally, we are very excited with the release of Unreal Engine 5 (yesterday 05 April), as with it comes with several solutions to important questions in nanos world (such as Runtime Retargetting which promises solving several animations compatibility issues) and tons of new features to be used! We gonna have good news soon\u2122 for you!\\n\\nSee you next month! \ud83e\udd73"},{"id":"february-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/february-2022","editUrl":"https://github.com/nanos-world/docs/edit/master/blog/2022-03-02-february.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-02-february.md","title":"February: Unreal 5 & Network Authority!","description":"Unreal Engine 5 Preview, new Network Authority System, Store API and more","date":"2022-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 2, 2022","tags":[{"label":"updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/updates"}],"readingTime":8.12,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel T.

All the sync relies of sharing data between the players and replicating in each client. This approach brings several advantages and of course some drawbacks, in the advantages we can include a very lightweight server, where we have all the control over it, without needing to rely on Unreal\'s server executable or the way it handles the network.\\n\\nIn the other hand we got some challenges on how to distribute physics information and other stuff. Then in the beginning we created our first Network Authority system in which each player is responsible for sharing a specific set of entities from the server to others, similar to [Roblox Solution](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Network-Ownership).\\n\\nHowever, just like in Roblox, some problems become more noticeable when we have many players connected with many different pings. As some players will receive the \\"network authority\\" over entities faster than others, they will start sharing their location/rotation to other players while the \'old\' network authority is still the authority over that because he didn\'t receive the \\"lost network authority\\" message yet.\\n\\nWe created this diagram to exemplify the problem:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/network-authority-problem.jpg)\\n\\nAs you could notice, there is a \\"gap\\" and a \\"overlap\\" when switching network authority if we have discrepancies between players ping, causing several weird behaviors on physics objects.\\n\\nConsidering this and after much study, we improved our Network Authority system to make it more robust, this new way aims to fill up the gaps and ignore overlaps:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/network-authority-solution.jpg)\\n\\n\\nWhile still in a \\"beta\\" version, with this new system we intend to improve all the \\"warnings\\" and flickering problems that were occurring since then, all feedback is appreciated!\\n\\n\\n## New Debug Modes\\n\\nWith the addition of the new Network Authority system, we are adding a new **Debug** section in the Settings.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/debug-settings.jpg)\\n\\nA cool setting is the **Draw Network Debug** which draws on World all network information:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/debug-visualizer.jpg)\\n\\nYou can find more information in the [Network Authority](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/core-concepts/scripting/authority-concepts#debugging-network--network-authority) page.\\n\\nAlso you can fake \\"packet loss\\" which will simulate some Sync Data being discarded.\\n\\n\\n## Store API\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/swagger.png)\\n\\nLast month we released our [Store](https://store.nanos.world), a place to share and download community Assets & Packages, integrated with the game.\\n\\nNow we are releasing the **Store API**: You can download, upload and edit your resources through HTTP requests, check it the Swagger documentation at https://api.nanos.world/store/docs. More tutorials coming soon\u2122.\\n\\n\\n## Documentation Changes\\n\\n### Modules\\n\\nWe\'ve added a new tutorial for creating your own C Module. You can check it out at the [Modules](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/core-concepts/modules#creating-your-own-c-module) page.\\n\\n\\n## Unreal Engine 5: Preview\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/matrix.webp)\\n\\nA week ago, Epic Games gave us the wonderful news that they were releasing [Unreal Engine 5: Preview](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-is-now-available-in-preview). A Preview release means most of the features are already present and almost ready for a final shipping version.\\n\\nAnd we, as good enthusiasts, and in addition to our other blog news ([November: Unreal Engine 5?](https://nanos.world/blog/november-2021)) decided to give another try on converting nanos world into Unreal Engine 5. And let\'s move to our impressions:\\n\\n\\n### Migrating nanos world\\n\\nThis time migrating nanos world to Unreal Engine 5: Preview was more trickier, we\'ve got even more deprecated methods and some functionalities changed and/or removed, which required more hard work converting and debugging what has changed.\\n\\nWe\'ve had to update a lot more code and files than the Early Access version to be able just to launch the Project. Also Vehicles had to be disabled due the new Chaos engine, which completely changes how Vehicles need to be implemented and we didn\'t want to bother on converting them right now.\\n\\n\\n### Graphics\\n\\nUnreal Engine 5 introduces [Lumen](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/lumen-in-ue5-let-there-be-light), a new dynamic Global Illumination method, and playing with it is very cool and impressive. Here\'s some screenshots taken from our Testing Map:\\n\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-01.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-02.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-03.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-08.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-09.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-10.jpg)\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nNext you can see how the object colors can reflect dynamically in the environment lights.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-04.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-05.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-06.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-07.jpg)\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nHere we can see the contribution of Emissive Materials to the environment.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/ue5-graphics-11.jpg)\\n\\nA cool feature is that we can enable Hardware-Accelerated for calculating Lumen (which replaces Hardware Ray Tracing), and tested with a RTX 3070 makes it even more beauty at a really low GPU cost.\\n\\n\\n### Technical\\n\\nIn the technical aspect, the biggest changes Unreal 5 brings are:\\n\\n- **Lumen** (Dynamic Global Illumination)\\n- **Nanite** (Mesh Virtualization)\\n- **Chaos** (new Physics Engine)\\n- and also not less important, the new features regarding World/Level creation (**One File Per Actor** and **World Partition**)\\n\\nWhile Lumen, Nanite and World features can be toggled on or off (we can choose to use it or not), the same truth is not valid for **Chaos**. Unreal is completely removing PhysX and replacing by it\'s new Physics Engine: **Chaos**. Although we are open to new things, unfortunately Chaos doesn\'t seem to be in a totally good state, neither at least at the same level/stability as PhysX.\\n\\nWe could experience several Collision glitches, such as objects flickering, wrong \\"collision boxes\\", objects flying through walls, bugs with Rope (Cable), objects sleeping randomly, bad Hit events callbacks and so on.\\n\\nMost of the problems we could find an workaround (like applying force to some objects so they don\'t sleep, or finding a workaround on the Cables settings), but the main problem we\'ve found using Chaos is the Hit feedback event, which are totally inconsistent, sometimes they are triggered with force 0, which annoys the hit sounds and also the nanos world Hit events from being triggered, and this can break gameplay/scripting functionalities.\\n\\nNot to mention the objects flickering/disappearing/losing collisions which gives a really bad impression on the game quality.\\n\\nAnd we didn\'t even started implementing the new Chaos Vehicles, can\'t wait what we gonna find there \ud83d\ude05.\\n\\n\\n### Stability\\n\\nActually, this version of Unreal surprised us positively, it had less crashes than in early access, but still had some, but in this case it was when we were stressing the game really hard using several balloons, cables and props flying around. Although I was a little disappointed as most of the bugs I found in the Early Access were still prevent in this Preview and weren\'t yet fixed.\\n\\nAlso some rare bugs could be noticed, like suddenly being teleported to the 0, 0, 0 location, which we couldn\'t yet find the reason.\\n\\n\\n### UE5 worth it now?\\n\\nSumming up, we\'ve created a list of positive and negative points according to our view regarding if we should or not migrate to Unreal 5 \\"right now\\":\\n\\nAlso, another point to consider: we are going to migrate to Unreal Engine 5 soon or later, the decision is \\"when\\". \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n\\n#### Negative Points \ud83d\udc4e\\n\\n- Gameplay Bugs related to Physics, objects jumping, flickering, bad collisions happening, objects passing through floor/walls due **Chaos**.\\n- Visual Artifacts, not only related to Lumen, but to the standard Rendering methods as well.\\n- Random Unreal internal Crashes, which we cannot fix by ourselves.\\n- More frequent Unreal updates, much probably we are going to have other Preview version, and after the UE5 release we are going to get several hotfixes, and each one will much likely require us from rebuilding all assets and publishing a new version of them, otherwise they won\'t work in the new versions. This means the Asset Packs won\'t work in newer Unreal versions.\\n- Using Lumen has it\'s drawbacks, such as the performance, which can hit from 25% to 50% of the FPS (but can be toggled on/off).\\n\\n\\n#### Positive Points \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n- We are going to be the first ones to explore Unreal Engine 5 (which can be bad because some problems no one figured out yet, but personally I love exploring new features and using new tools).\\n- nanos world will have a great self-marketing potential, and also can bring lots of new enthusiasts on UE5 to know, play and create with the game.\\n- Lumen is fun and beautiful.\\n- New World/Level tools which allows creating big maps and also improves a lot the co-creations pipelines using the **One File Per Actor** system and **World Partition**!\\n- New Unreal Editor which has a fresh and pleasing look.\\n- Lots of new tools and technology to use, including Nanite, Chaos Destruction, Animation tools (which can help us from dynamically linking your custom Animation Blueprint) and the new MetaSounds.\\n- It\'s really hard to convert nanos world from scratch every update to test it\'s stability, I can\'t reuse the previous conversion because many changes are in blueprints (UI) that I can\'t merge and lots had changed since then. So converting once and right now we can already start digging, fixing stuff and the next unreal updates will be easier and faster to test and maintain.\\n\\n\\nUnlike Early Access, this version seemed to have more positives than negatives points, and it seems like a better opportunity than before to officially migrate nanos world. Come to our [Discord](https://discord.nanos.world) to discuss this idea with us! We are going to make a poll to bring all feedback from the community!\\n\\n\\n## Community Spotlight\\n\\nHere we\'d like to share all amazing stuff our community is doing the last weeks!\\n\\n\\nTimmy is doing an amazing job, and is sharing it\'s new Inventory System:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/february/timmy-inventory.jpg)\\n\\nAlso Timmy created a nice smooth Weather system transition:\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/february/timmy-weather-01.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/february/timmy-weather-02.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\nMegaThorx released it\'s brand new [EGUI](https://store.nanos.world/packages/egui/) library.

Canvas is like a painting frame, you can draw anything onto it, from Lines, Squares to Materials and Textures!\\n\\nYou can also use it as UI or paint any object with a Canvas using `:SetMaterialFromCanvas()`!\\n\\nNow it\'s way easier to create a basic UI!\\n\\n```lua\\n-- Spawns a Canvas\\nlocal canvas = Canvas(true, Color.TRANSPARENT, 0, true)\\n\\n-- Subscribes for Update, we can only Draw inside this event\\ncanvas:Subscribe(\\"Update\\", function(self, width, height)\\n  -- Draws a Text in the middle of the screen\\n  self:DrawText(\\"Hello World!\\", Vector2D(width / 2, height / 2))\\n\\n  -- Draws a red line Horizontally\\n  self:DrawLine(Vector2D(0, height / 2), Vector2D(width, height / 2), 10, Color.RED)\\nend)\\n```\\n\\nThe [Basic HUD (Canvas) Tutorial](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/getting-started/tutorials-and-examples/basic-hud-canvas) has been updated as well!\\n\\n\\n## Steam Input + Controller\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/controller.jpg)\\n\\nWe\'ve managed to integrate Steam Input. If you are not familiar with that, Steam Input allows you to set up and play with any Controller, and also configure it through Steam Interface.\\n\\nIt is a nice integration because it\'s a relatively simple implementation that allows nanos world to be played with controllers, and it gives users the possibility to customize bindings and share with the community.\\n\\nAn initial version has been released in the latest update, more bindings and configurations will come next.\\n\\n\\n## New built-in Key Glyphs\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/glyphs.jpg)\\n\\nWe\'ve added a utility method to retrieve a Glyph/Image from a given Key. Just use `Input.GetKeyIcon(key_name)` and it will return the path of the image which can be used as Texture or as an usual image `<img>` in the HTML!\\n\\nYou can use it combined with `Input.GetMappedKey()` to dynamically get the Key Glyph based on the user\'s key binding configuration.\\n\\n\\n## Bullet Trails Improvement\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/january/bullet-trail.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nWe have reworked our default Bullet Trail particles. Before, depending on the point of view you could see a big sphere passing through and also several glitches in the sky. Now it was reworked to be more realistic and without any artifact!\\n\\n\\n## New Map Configurations\\n\\nNow it is possible to create individual Configuration files for each Map, in which you can define all compatible game-modes, spawn locations and add custom data as well!\\n\\nAlso, it is possible to set up a complete Package which will automatically load when this map is loaded.\\n\\n```toml title=\\"Map.toml\\"\\n# map configurations\\n[map]\\n    # compatible game-modes\\n    compatible_game_modes = [\\n        \\"sandbox\\",\\n        \\"deathmatch\\"\\n    ]\\n\\n    # list of spawn points\\n    spawn_points = [\\n        { location = \\"Vector(100, 200, 100)\\", rotation = \\"Rotator(0, 90, 0)\\" },\\n        { location = \\"Vector(200, 300, 100)\\", rotation = \\"Rotator(0, 90, 0)\\" },\\n    ]\\n\\n[custom_data]\\n    whatever = \\"anything\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nCheck the complete documentation at [Map Script & Data](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/assets-modding/creating-assets/maps-and-levels/map-script-and-data).\\n\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nThe following changes were added back in **1.1.0-1.3.0** update, we gonna highlight the best ones here!\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Interactive CLI\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/interactive-cli.jpg)\\n\\nAn amazing and extremely useful functionality that has been added to the CLI is the creation of Asset Packs & Packages interactively.\\n\\nUse `add [package|assets] NAME` and it will create the Asset Pack or Package interactively, it will create the Configuration and Default files as well!\\n\\n\\n## Actor Tags\\n\\nAt the request of our testers, we implemented a interface to access Unreal\'s Actor Tags, with `Actor.SetActorTag()` and `Actor.GetActorTag()` you can set/get unreal Actor Tags directly from Scripting (client side).\\n\\nActor Tags are just an array of strings which can be accessed from anywhere, including from Unreal Blueprint. This small addition increases the range of possibilities for integration with blueprints and external implementations.\\n\\n\\n## New Class: [SceneCapture](/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/scene-capture)\\n\\nThis is a very cool feature released back in **1.1.0** update.\\n\\n**SceneCapture** is a Camera Actor which captures the environment in real time, and we can get the outputted result with `:SetMaterialFromSceneCapture()` into any other Actor!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/january/scene-capture.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nIt has several configurable performance tweaks which makes it more efficient if you are not looking at the actors and also reduces the capture rate if you are too far!\\n\\n\\n## Assets Caching\\n\\nWe\'ve implemented a great feature which improves the performance and reduce stuttering when (re)loading Assets in runtime. Stuttering usually happen when using HDD and when loading something from Disk. Now every loaded asset (including files from disk - **.ogg** and **.jpg**) is cached and reused when loading again automatically. We still intend to add some options to auto load all assets from all loaded Asset Packs when entering a server and also a scriptable option to async load an Asset prior the use to further improve the stuttering and add more freedom to the scripters.\\n\\n\\n## Light Profiles\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/light-profile.jpg)\\n\\nWe\'ve added a new cool setting for Lights: **Light Profile**, which allows changing the Light Profile Texture of a Light with [Light:SetTextureLightProfile()](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/light#settexturelightprofile).\\n\\nIt is possible to set to one of our built-in [Light Profiles](https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/scripting-reference/glossary/enums#lightprofile). All built-in Light Profiles were imported from [IES Light Profile Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/ies-light-profile-pack).\\n\\nThis can add a realistic Flashlight effect to your Lights for example.\\n\\n\\n## Vehicle Improvements\\n\\nNow it is possible to manually control if the Vehicle Engine is started or not, also if it auto starts when a driver gets in with `Vehicle:SetAutoStartEngine()`.\\n\\nAlso we added a small detail: **Taillights**, it gets Red when braking and White when going backwards, it is customizable with `Vehicle:SetTaillightsSetup()`:\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/january/vehicle-taillight.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThe Vehicle Mesh colors are still not in sync with the Headlights neither the Taillights, this will be improved in the next updates!\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## Parachute Customization\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/parachute.jpg)\\n\\nWe\'ve added an useful customization to the built-in parachute, now it\'s possible to change it\'s texture with `Character:SetParachuteTexture(texture)`. Also, all built-in Textures can be found at `nanos-world/NanosWorld/Content/NanosWorld/Textures/Parachute/` and used like `assets///nanos-world/Textures/Parachute`.\\n\\n\\n## Community Spotlight\\n\\nOur community has been working hard on several amazing stuff, we would like to share it with you!\\n\\n### T-Drones\\n\\n*by Timmy*\\n\\nTimmy worked on very cool fully functional Drone package, check it out! Fully integrated with the new SceneCapture for a \\"3D Camera System\\". Also the Drone has a function to back to home! Amazing!\\n\\n> T-Drones is a script designed to emulate the behavior of hobby drones, and thought to run on the vast majority of game-modes.\\n> \\n> It has been conceived to be as modular as possible and to adapt to the needs of anyone who wants to make modifications or additions easily.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"620\\" height=\\"347\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TEzEKiGgDo0?vq=hd1080\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\n### KOTOR RP\\n\\n*by ERO Team (NegativeName, Mougel, False & Tark)*\\n\\nThe ERO Team is working hard on a blasting Star Wars RP game-mode (KOTOR RP), this gonna be dope! Here\'s some screenshots of the worlds and the Combo system of the Light Saber!\\n\\n> Star Wars KOTOR RP is a french role-play game-mode in the Star Wars universe.\\n> \\n> You will play a character in this distant galaxy. Your role will depend on you. Will you join the Sith Empire to enslave the galaxy, protect it by joining the Galactic Republic, or take no side.\\n> \\n> The choice is yours! Become a Jedi, a Sith, a soldier, a mercenary, or a simple merchant. \\n\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/star-wars-01.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/star-wars-02.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/star-wars-03.jpg)\\n\\n\\n### T-Bomber\\n\\n*by Timmy*\\n\\nAlso Timmy is creating a Bomberman game-mode! Excellent work, I can\'t wait to play it!\\n\\n> T-Bomber is a Bomberman-like game-mode Heavily inspired by the famous maze game.\\n> \\n> It aims to replicate the original Bomberman experience with some extra spice, and to show off some of the scripting possibilities of nanos world.\\n> \\n> The rules are very simple, the last one alive wins!\\n\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/january/timmy-bomberman-01.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/january/timmy-bomberman-03.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/january/timmy-bomberman-02.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n### VZombies\\n\\n*by Voltaism*\\n\\nVoltaism is working on his Zombies game-mode based on COD\'s one. It\'s incredibly fun and horrifying!\\n\\n> Nearly finished game-mode that is basically a clone of the classic Call Of Duty: Zombies mode where you have to survive against zombies the longer as you can!\\n> \\n> This game-mode also has bots that can play with you. \\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/vzombies-01.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/vzombies-02.jpg)\\n\\n\\n### nanos BattleField 2043\\n\\n*by LighterChu, Trevor & MemeFrug*\\n\\n> Battlefield 2042 came out, we expected the best. Why did we make nanos battlefield 2043, well it is not just Battlefield 2042 it\'s all battlefields mixed in the future of combine titles are here.\\n\\n![](/videos/blog/january/battlefield-01.gif)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/january/battlefield-01.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThank you again for your feedback and support, every suggestion and bug found makes the nanos world wheel spin faster and faster!\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThis blog contained several highlights of our progress in the last month. Note that countless improvements, bug fixes and some other new features are available in the changelog on our [Discord](https://discord.nanos.world) and also in-game.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nWe are aware of your biggest requests and we want to implement them as soon as possible to make the nanos world API more and more complete. We still have a long roadmap to go through, and we have big pillars of goals to bring new types of vehicles (including air and sea), customizable characters (any skeleton), direct Blueprint support and more!\\n\\nRight away we desire to rework our Steam Store Page, it was left behind due to some technical issues and we want to revive it, with that we desire to do a rebranding of the nanos world, we know that logos and great capsule images that relate to the game theme are of great importance for Steam self-marketing to attract new players!\\n\\nSee you in the next! Thank you!"},{"id":"november-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/november-2021","editUrl":"https://github.com/nanos-world/docs/edit/master/blog/2021-12-01-unreal-engine-5.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-01-unreal-engine-5.md","title":"November: Unreal Engine 5?","description":"New Classes, Unreal Engine 5 Experiments and Scripting Improvements!","date":"2021-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/updates"}],"readingTime":6.435,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel T.

Decals are Materials that are projected onto meshes in your level, including Static Meshes and Skeletal Meshes. You can load any `.jpg` from disk during runtime and use it as parameter in your Decal Material!\\n\\nAs Decals are inherited from Actors, you can change it\'s location, rotation, attach it or call any method from [Base Actor](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor) on it!\\n\\n\\n## New Class: [Billboard](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/billboard)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/billboard.jpg)\\n\\nWe\'ve added another new class to spawning **Billboards**! A Billboard is a 2D Material that will be rendered always facing the camera. It\'s possible to use all custom methods from Paintable as well and spawning custom textures on it. You can tweak it\'s material properties with [Base Paintable](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/paintable) or even use a material of your own.\\n\\nAs Billboards are inherited from Actors, you can change it\'s location, rotation, attach it or call any method from [Base Actor](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor) on it!\\n\\n\\n## New Class: [Melee](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/melee)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/melee.jpg)\\n\\nWe are getting a brand new very-requested class: **Melee**! The Melee is coming to replace the former **Item** class.\\n\\n**Melee** is a new Class (which works exactly as the old **Item**) but now with ability to attack with it. It is possible to add custom animations, a cooldown and tweak the damage of it. The attack physics is procedurally based on the animation, this means you can stab, slash or even smash things only by changing the animation and then the hit will be based on that!\\n\\nThe results are quite fun, the hit/damage also affects the environment dynamically \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/november/melee.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## Scripting Improvements\\n\\nWe\'ve listen to your demand and we\'re finally bringing long-awaited new amazing scripting features!\\n\\n### Real Hot Reload\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/hotreload.jpg)\\n\\nAfter several requests, we\'ve started implementing a real Hot Reload feature!\\n\\nThe real **Hot Reloading** is an amazing feature which allows you loading new scripting code without needing to lose all the current memory state of your Packages. It works by loading the scripting files over the current running Lua VM.\\n\\nCurrently it works by manually triggering it in the console:\\n\\n```bash\\npackage hotreload [PACKAGE_NAME|all]\\n```\\n\\nThis will update the clients with the newer files version and load the `Index.lua` files from the packages. It will keep the current memory state of the packages as it is. It will also unsubscribe from all registered Events in that package.\\n\\nIn the future, it would be possible to add a real-time checker to automatically update the modified files after saving them.\\n\\n\\n### Extending Classes\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/extending.jpg)\\n\\nA new cool feature that is being added is Extending and Inheriting nanos world Classes. *This is still experimental and we want to collect your feedback and find remaining bugs.*\\n\\nIt is now possible to **Add new Methods** to nanos world Classes, **Override existing Methods** and even **Override __index and __newindex**.\\n\\nAdding a new method to a class is easy like this:\\n\\n```lua\\n-- Adding a new method \'AddScore\' to Player class\\nfunction Player:AddScore(score)\\n    self:SetValue(\\"score\\", self:GetValue(\\"score\\", 0) + score)\\nend\\n\\n-- Using it\\nmy_player:AddScore(10)\\n```\\n\\nRead the full documentation [here](/docs/core-concepts/scripting/extending-classes).\\n\\n\\n## New View Mode: TopDown\\n\\nWe created a new native View Mode: **TopDown**!\\n\\nThis ViewMode allows you to fully control Characters from a TopDown perspective.\\n\\nWith just a single line:\\n\\n```lua\\nmy_character:SetViewMode(ViewMode.TopDown)\\n```\\n\\nnanos world becomes a completely different game, the mouse is now a crosshair which the Character aims to. Mechanics of picking up Weapons, grabbing Props and interacting with stuff was slightly modified to work with the ViewMode. Also driving is fully supported as well! \ud83e\udd29\\n\\nIt also is possible to dynamically change the view mode and switch between them during game-play and also tweak settings such as camera distance and so on.\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/november/top-down.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## New Camera Methods\\n\\nPlayer got a bunch of new Camera methods: `Player:SetCameraSocketOffset()`, `Player:SetCameraArmLength()`.\\n\\nAnd also ability to detach and attach it to other actors (\ud83d\udc40 including Props): `Player:AttachCameraTo()` and `Player:ResetCamera()`. It will attach including a Camera SpringArm component!\\n\\nNote: **Spectate** methods from **Client** has been moved to **Player**: `Player:Spectate()`.\\n\\n\\n## [TextRender](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/text-render) on Server Side\\n\\nNow the Class `TextRender` now can be spawned on Server Side as well!\\n\\n\\n## Other Changes\\n\\nBesides the major topics covered here, we\'ve got several other new features which were been added during the month:\\n\\n- Added a new method for Character: `Character:Follow()` which will make the AI follow other actor.\\n- Added a new Utils method: `NanosUtils.Benchmark()` which will take a function as parameter and test the performance of it.\\n- Now `Subscribe` will return the callback function (which can be used to Unsubscribe afterwards).\\n- Fixed tons of bugs, detailed information can be found in the Discord Changelog channel.\\n\\n\\n## Unreal Engine 5\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5.jpg)\\n\\nLastly, it is already known we have a big objective of porting nanos world to Unreal Engine 5. Personally this is something I wanted to do as soon as possible because Unreal Engine 5 features are amazing, not to mention the publicity and marketing bonuses we would get for nanos world.\\n\\nIn this month, we decided to give a try: we tested porting nanos world to Unreal 5, at first we had some problems because of some Unreal modules have been completely renamed or even removed. And also we got some Unreal methods deprecated by the newer version, so we needed to update them and even reimplement some small stuff.\\n\\nCurrently Unreal Engine 4 uses PhysX physics and in Unreal 5 all the Physics Engine have been replaced by [Unreal\'s Chaos](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/PhysicsFeatures/ChaosVSPhysxOverview/), which is a new Engine replacing the NVIDIA\'s PhysX.\\n\\nThis made us need to disable Vehicles for this test, as Unreal vehicles are very dependent on the PhysX engine and I would need to reimplement them using the new Chaos API for vehicles (I believe that our Vehicles API will need to change a bit as well once we fully update it).\\n\\nBut after half of dozen adaptions and disabled Vehicles, the results were surprisingly good! nanos world worked on Unreal Engine 5! Personally I got very happy and proud that the biggest problems I had was updating deprecate methods and updating some Unreal modules, thanks to the architecture developed so far in nanos world!\\n\\n\\n### Graphical Results\\n\\nnanos world on Unreal Engine 5 is beautiful, joying with Lumen and Global Illumination is really fun!\\n\\nThere were some graphical artifacts (such as changing the time of day too fast causing a delay/ghosting effect), but I believe they will improve them for the final Unreal Engine 5 version.\\n\\nCheck it out some screenshots taken during the tests trying the Global Illumination and Lumen:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-outside.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-gas-01.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-gas-02.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-flash-01.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-flash-02.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-flash-03.jpg)\\n\\n\\n### Stability\\n\\nUnfortunately the stability was extremely bad. It didn\'t surprise me too much as Unreal Engine 5 is on Early Access, so bugs and crashes would happen. Several random crashes occurred during gameplay, I could notice mostly of them were caused by the new Chaos Engine (related to Physics).\\n\\n\\n### What now?\\n\\nI was really happy in being able to port nanos world to Unreal Engine 5, this attempt made us be sure that this would be possible. But I decided that currently is not time yet. During the tests we had several crashes (random ones, related to the low-level of Unreal, mainly coming from Chaos Engine and from Water) that made us conclude that is better to wait a better stable version because it makes nanos world really unplayable. Those random crashes are extremely bad as sometimes it\'s hard to know if it\'s my or Unreal\'s fault.\\n\\nFortunately, with this we could prove ourselves that nanos world will, when the time comes, be compatible and updated to Unreal Engine 5!"},{"id":"alpha-released","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/alpha-released","editUrl":"https://github.com/nanos-world/docs/edit/master/blog/2021-11-03-alpha-released.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-03-alpha-released.md","title":"October: Alpha released!","description":"We proudly present...","date":"2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 3, 2021","tags":[{"label":"updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/updates"}],"readingTime":10.95,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel T.

Our community has grown a lot and it\'s lovely to see how nice and friendly it is becoming \ud83e\udd70!\\n\\nThe Playtest session in the Sunday was amazing! We were able to test the stability of the game very well. I can say that most of the crashes we had were related to external integration issues (WebUI or Unreal itself), which shows a great maturity of our Core system. I think about doing it more often, it was a lot of fun playing Halloween mode and testing the community game-modes!\\n\\nFrom now on, all updates will start to be versioned (finally!), small updates/non break-changes will get a PATCH version and break-changing will get a MINOR version.\\n\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThe following changelog contains all features since last officially announced release 0.73.0. Many of the next items were already in the bleeding-edge branch.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<iframe class=\\"steam-widget\\" src=\\"https://store.steampowered.com/widget/1841660/\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" width=\\"620\\" height=\\"190\\" loading=\\"lazy\\"></iframe>\\n\\n\\n## Materials\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/material.jpg)\\n\\nNow nanos world supports Materials Assets! \ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nThis means you can configure your own materials in your Assets.toml and reference them using [Paintable](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/paintable) methods!\\n\\nThe function `:SetDefaultMaterial()` has been replaced with `:SetMaterial()`. You can see a list of all built-in Materials read to use [here](/docs/next/assets-modding/default-asset-pack/default-materials).\\n\\nAlso it is now possible to get the WebUI material and set it to any surface (read more below)!\\n\\nSome existing methods are suffering a rework due that, e.g. [Pickables](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/pickable) got a new method `:SetCrosshairMaterial()`, so you can set the Crosshair from a Material (and not from a predefined list anymore), also all old Crosshair have been converted into materials which you can find [here](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/pickable#list-of-crosshairs-materials-included-in-default-asset-pack).\\n\\n\\n## Improved WebUI\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/webui.jpg)\\n\\nThe [WebUI](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/webui) received several improvements, including the ability to run HTML5 Audio and Videos! \ud83d\udcfd\\n\\n:::caution\\n\\nWe are using a Beta version of Ultralight, which supports Audio and Video, crashes **WILL** happen, also the Audio is currently 2D only. Ultralight is working on a solution so I can implement 3D audio.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThe **WebUI** constructor received some new parameters: **is_transparent**, **auto_resize**, **width** and **height**. Width and Height will only be used if Auto Resize is **OFF**, this is useful if you want to spawn a WebUI to use as Material to any surface (and don\'t want it to be the size of the screen).\\n\\nAlso it received new methods: [:SetFreeze()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/webui#setfreeze), [:Resize()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/webui#resize) and [:SetAutoResize()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/webui#setautoresize).\\n\\nA new Searcher has been added onto it, improving how it can load your .html files, they are now looked in the following order:\\n1. Relative to `current-file-path/`\\n2. Relative to `current-package/Client/`\\n3. Relative to `current-package/`\\n4. Relative to `Packages/`\\n\\nIt is now possible to spawn a Material from a WebUI, which renders dynamic and automatically into **any** surface: `:SetMaterialFromWebUI()` (method from Actors).\\n\\n\\n## Actors\\n\\nNew additions for [Actors](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor):\\n\\n* Added new method for all actors: [:SetLifeSpan(time)](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#setlifespan) which will automatically destroy this actor after `time` seconds.\\n* Added new method for all actors: [:IsBeingDestroyed()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#isbeingdestroyed) which will return if this actor is being destroyed (useful to check from inside other Events such as `Drop` or `Ungrab`).\\n* Added new parameter for all actors [:AttachTo()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#attachto) method: `lifespan_when_detached`, which will destroy the actor after `time` seconds after it\'s detached.\\n* Now event [TakeDamage](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#takedamage) has a new argument: `causer` (the object/actor which caused the damage). Also added new damage types: `RunOverVehicle` and `RunOverProp`.\\n* Now event [Hit](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#hit) has new arguments: `impact_force`, `normal_impulse`, `impact_location` and `velocity`.\\n* Now [:SetLocation()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#setlocation) will try to find the better spot to teleport the Actor (to avoid collisions).\\n\\n\\n## Character\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/character.jpg)\\n\\nNew additions for [Characters](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character):\\n\\n**Character Methods additions/improvements:**\\n* Added several new Getters from it\'s properties.\\n* Added [:SetDamageMultiplier()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#setdamagemultiplier) change the damage multiplier depending on the bone damaged.\\n* Added [:SetHiddenBone()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#sethiddenbone) to make invisible any part of the body.\\n* Added [:SetJumpZVelocity()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#setjumpzvelocity) to make the character jump higher.\\n* Improved [:PlayAnimation()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#playanimation) got new parameters (blend times, loop and play rate), and now it supports loading any type of animation (Montage or Sequence).\\n* Removed `:SetInitialLocation()`, it has been replaced with [:Respawn()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#respawn).\\n\\n**Character Events additions/improvements:**\\n* Added [AttemptEnterVehicle](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#attemptentervehicle) called when Character tries to enter a vehicle, returns false to prevent it.\\n* Added [AttemptLeaveVehicle](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#attemptleavevehicle) called when Character tries to leave a vehicle, returns false to prevent it.\\n* Added [AttemptReload](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#attemptreload) called when Character tries to reload it\'s weapon, returns false to prevent it.\\n* Added [Interact](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#interact) called when Characters tries to Pick Up a Pickable or Grab a Prop.\\n* Added [Highlight](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#highlight) called when Characters looks at a Prop or Pickable being able to pick up it.\\n\\nSome Characters animations have been renamed from `AM_` to `A_` in the Default Asset Pack (as they are not Montages anymore). Also lots of new Animations have been added.\\n\\n\\n## Weapons\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/weapon.jpg)\\n\\nNew additions for [Weapons](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon):\\n\\n**Weapon Methods additions/improvements:**\\n* Added several new Getters from it\'s properties.\\n* Added [:SetRecoil()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setrecoil) how much the weapon recoils physically.\\n* Added [:SetWallbangSettings()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setwallbangsettings) configure if bullets wallbangs walls.\\n* Added [:SetAnimationFire()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setanimationfire) animation on Weapon Skeletal when firing.\\n* Added [:SetSoundFireLastBullets()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setsoundfirelastbullets) sound when `N` last bullets are remaining in the clip.\\n* Improved [:SetAnimationReload()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setanimationreload) now has `play_rate` parameter.\\n\\n**Additional stuff:**\\n* Now weapons are hidden when Characters are driving.\\n* Added sounds of Shell Dropping & hitting the ground for the built-in Shell particles (this is a procedural and 100% precise sound \ud83d\ude09).\\n* Added sounds when picking up or dropping weapons, also it will slightly throw the weapon to the front when dropping it.\\n\\n\\n## Grenades\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/grenade.jpg)\\n\\nAll Properties from [Grenades](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/grenade) have been deprecated, now access must be done through Methods.\\n\\nWe\'ve added a special Particle for Grenades `nanos-world::P_Grenade_Special` which will explode different particles depending on the ground the grenade is. I.e. will explode a \\"grass explosion\\" particle if grenade is over a grass surface, and a \\"water explosion\\" particle if it\'s under water. **Note:** This particle only works for Grenades.\\n\\n\\n## Sounds\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/sound.jpg)\\n\\nNew additions for [Sounds](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/sound):\\n\\nNow it is possible to load `.ogg` sounds at runtime! You can store them in any Package or Asset Pack and load it using our new pattern for `SpecialPath` (`assets///asset-pack-name/path.ogg` or `package///package-name/path.ogg`).\\n\\nAdded `loop_mode` parameter to constructor (can loop any sound forever now).\\n\\nAlso, it is possible to pass `.ogg` using the SpecialPath in any Sound parameter.\\n\\n**Sound Methods additions/improvements:**\\n* Added [:GetDuration()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/sound#getduration).\\n* Improved [:FadeIn()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/sound#fadein) and [:FadeOut()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/sound#fadeout) parameters.\\n\\n\\n## Input\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/input.jpg)\\n\\nAdded a new class: [Input](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/input)!\\n\\nNow you can control, create and customize KeyBindings in a proper way! Example:\\n\\n```lua\\n-- Registers the binding_name \'SpawnMenu\' with default key \'Q\'\\n-- This will add \'SpawnMenu\' to user KeyBinding Settings automatically\\nInput.Register(\\"SpawnMenu\\", \\"Q\\")\\n\\n-- Subscribes for Pressing the key\\nInput.Bind(\\"SpawnMenu\\", InputEvent.Pressed, function()\\n    -- Opens the Spawn Menu\\nend)\\n\\n-- Subscribes for Releasing the key\\nInput.Bind(\\"SpawnMenu\\", InputEvent.Released, function()\\n    -- Closes the Spawn Menu\\nend)\\n```\\n\\n\\n## HTTP\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/http.jpg)\\n\\nAdded a new class: [HTTP](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/http)!\\n\\nNow we have a proper standalone class for making HTTP requests. Is also features Async HTTP requests (and thread safe!)\\n\\n\\n## Performance Optimization\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/performance.jpg)\\n\\nWe have worked hard on performance techniques for Alpha update. Here\'s the highlights:\\n\\n* Now Basic Structs [Vector](/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/vector) and [Rotator](/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/rotator) are automatically compressed when sending through the Network. Reducing it\'s size up to 90% in the best case! This was a great gain for network use.\\n* A new setting was added `Profiling` which you can enable with `--profiling` on server and in Settings on Client. This will log all the time elapsed to run operations/scripting events and some other stuff in the Console.\\n* Now HTTP requests (a.k.a. downloading files when joining a server) are automatically compressed, which may reduce the network usage when downloading big files!\\n* Now Actors which are very far or not on screen will be synchronized/updated half the time to improve performance. We still want to tweak it and make it more aggressive on some cases.\\n* The Assets Loading system have been reworked and is much faster now.\\n* Small [Props](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/prop) (radius < 200) will not collide with players or dynamic objects anymore. Also Bigger props will have CCD disabled by default (which drastically improved performance), this can be enabled in the Prop constructor.\\n* Now VOIP uses Steam system, which provides a great compression and also custom settings through Shift+Tab menu.\\n* Several improvements were made on our low-level Lua code to boost scripting performance.\\n\\n\\n## Server\\n\\nNew additions to [Server](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server) static class:\\n\\n* Added new console command: `map [MAP_NAME]` to change the game map, this will also reload all packages and reconnect all players (like restarting the server).\\n* Added new methods [Server.GetVersion()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server#getversion), [Server.GetIP()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server#getip), [Server.GetPort()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server#getport), [Server.GetQueryPort()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server#getqueryport) and several missing getters.\\n\\n\\n## Client\\n\\nNew additions to [Client](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client) static class:\\n\\n* New parameters have been added to [Client.SetCameraLocation()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#setcameralocation) and [Client.SetCameraRotation()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#setcamerarotation) to enable smooth movements with camera in a certain time.\\n* New methods for drawing debug shapes in 3D world: [Client.DrawDebug...()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#drawdebug).\\n* Changed [Client.SetHighlight()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#sethighlight) parameters, now it takes a Enum to define how the highlight will be.\\n* Added new method [Client.SetSteamRichPresence()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#setsteamrichpresence) to customize the message in Steam Friends list.\\n\\nNow when joining a server, a Progress Bar will be displayed in the Taskbar, and also it will Flash once the loading is done:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/progress-taskbar.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## In-game Console\\n\\nNow it is possible to access Server Console from within the game!\\n\\nIf you open it, 2 tabs will appear: **client** and **server**. You can read all server logs, and also input commands.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nNot all logs will appear in there, only the ones outputted while you are connected to the server.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/console.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Timer\\n\\nNew additions to [Timer](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/timer):\\n\\n* Added new method: [Timer.Bind(timer_id, actor)](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/timer#bind) - this will associate a timer to an actor, when the actor is destroyed, this timer is destroyed too and will never be called.\\n* Added new method: [Timer.IsValid(timer_id)](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/timer#isvalid).\\n\\n\\n## CLI\\n\\n* Now it is possible to download multiple Assets/Packages at once with [CLI](/docs/core-concepts/server-manual/nanos-world-cli), just separate them by spaces, e.g.: `cli assets install quaternius city-park`.\\n\\n\\n## Steam Achievements\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/achievements.jpg)\\n\\nWith Steam integration, we are making use of every feature possible it allows \ud83d\ude05!\\n\\nAnd this includes the **Achievements**! We are counting on the support of a talented friend [Esther](https://www.instagram.com/estherhoffmann/) who is drawing the amazing arts for them!\\n\\nLittle by little we will be creating more achievements and releasing them! We also count on your ideas for more!\\n\\n\\n## Scripting Improvements\\n\\n* Added new Searchers to [Package.Require()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/package#require), we now currently support 5 searchers, which are looked in the following order:\\n    1. Relative to `current-file-path/`\\n    2. Relative to `current-package/Client/` or `current-package/Server/` *(depending on your side)*\\n    3. Relative to `current-package/Shared/`\\n    4. Relative to `current-package/`\\n    5. Relative to `Packages/`\\n\\n* [Package.Require()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/package#require) now can be called in runtime and at any moment.\\n* [Package.RequirePackage()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/package#requirepackage) now will load a package as a library inside the current package, it means the package loaded will now be automatically sent to clients, and all paths it loads is relative to the package itself (and not to the one which is requiring it anymore).\\n* Verbose logs will now display the current thread ID.\\n\\n\\n## Renamed Default Packages\\n\\nThe default Packages `NanosWorldWeapons` and `NanosWorldVehicles` were renamed to `nanos-world-weapons` and `nanos-world-vehicles`, following the new correct pattern for Packages and Assets names. Including them now should be made like `Package.RequirePackage(\\"nanos-world-weapons\\")`, the usage keeps the same (`NanosWorldWeapons.AK47()`).\\n\\n\\n## General Changes\\n\\n* [Cable](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/cable) got new methods: `:GetAttachedStartTo()` and `:GetAttachedEndTo()` to get if it\'s attached at any end.\\n* [Player](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/player) got new methods: `:SetVOIPVolume()`, `:GetSteamID()`,\\n* [Pickables](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/pickable) got new events: `ReleaseUse`, `PullUse` when Character pulls or releases its usage (i.e. trigger for weapons)\\n* Improved the way the interact trigger enables for [Pickables](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/pickable) and [Props](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/prop).\\n* [Trigger](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/trigger) got new method: `:ForceOverlapChecking()` which will checks for overlaps in the game thread and immediately dispatch events.\\n* Added new methods for [Quaternions](/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/quaternion) (+, -, Normalize).\\n* Added new method for generating a random [Rotator](/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/rotator): `Rotator.Random()`.\\n* Added lots of new Sounds, Animations, Props, Meshes in the Default Asset Pack.\\n* Added Steam Login.\\n* All .config files had it\'s `tabs` replaced with `spaces`.\\n* `.GetPairs()` now only supports `pairs`.\\n* Added Resolutions graphic settings.\\n* Make Day button from In-game menu has been removed.\\n* Added new Splash Effects when Props or objects enter the Water.\\n* `:GetValue()` now has an additional parameter: `fallback` which will be returned if the value doesn\'t exist.\\n* Probably many other things that were being added and were forgotten \ud83d\ude1c.\\n\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n\\n* Fixed `World.SetFogDensity()` not working.\\n* Fixed `Client.SetCameraLocation` not working.\\n* Fixed `Actors.RotateTo()` not doing properly math.\\n* Fixed `StaticMesh.GetBounds()` not working.\\n* Fixed Cables methods being able to be called on client side.\\n* Fixed several **Character** properties not syncing.\\n* Fixed a crash when changing Map at runtime.\\n* Fixed Characters not reseting the life to `max_health` when Respawning.\\n* Fixed dead ragdolls still moving around (from `MoveTo()`).\\n* Fixed infinite recursion with `LogEntry` event.\\n* Fixed **Characters** Morph Targets not syncing.\\n* Fixed Discord custom integration not working sometimes.\\n* Fixed a crash when a player had no Steam Profile image.\\n* Fixed Server Announce checkbox being disabled when unchecked on New Game screen.\\n* Fixed a crash when destroying entities from inside `Interact` event.\\n* Fixed hell lot of other Crashes \ud83d\udca5.

In the past weeks, we\'ve been working on improving and adding small features to common actions such as firing, picking up objects and even how you perceive them happening. Here\'s the highlights!\\n\\n\\n## New Weapon Animations\\n\\nSince the beginning, our weapons were stiff when shooting giving an impression of rigidity and lack of fluidity. With the simple improvement of adding firing animations to that, look how it looks better:\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/m1911.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/makarov.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## New effects for Bullet Shells\\n\\nBesides new animations, we added a subtle detail: **Bullet Shells Drop SFX**. And not that simple! The sound is precisely played in the location and moment the shells hit the ground or any surface, listen:\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/bullet-shell-drop.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nCheck out a complete before and after comparison of some of the weapons, you can notice all the improvements in detail!\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"620\\" height=\\"347\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ln4AUntcyLM\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n<br />\\n<br />\\n\\nNote that nanos world weapons animations and aiming are completely generated procedurally, that means when you are in First Person, the weapon sight location is calculated dynamically to be positioned right in the middle of your eyes, in a true first person mode.\\n\\n\\n## SFX when Picking Up objects\\n\\nA subtle sound detail added when you grab and drop a Weapon, and also now the object is slightly thrown to forward:\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/picking-up.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## Scopes\\n\\nIs is really easy to add attachable objects in any Weapon, for example attaching a AWP Scope, we use the `SM_Scope_25x56` mesh for that:\\n\\n```lua\\n-- Spawns a AWP Weapon\\nlocal weapon = Weapon(location or Vector(), rotation or Rotator(), \\"nanos-world::SK_AWP\\")\\n\\n-- Attaches a Scope mesh, with configured offset to be perfectly aligned\\nweapon:AddStaticMeshAttached(\\"sight\\", \\"nanos-world::SM_Scope_25x56\\", \\"\\", Vector(20, 0, 11))\\n\\n-- Adjusts Sight Location to put the Sniper at exact location where the scope center will be when ADS\\nweapon:SetSightTransform(Vector(-15, 0, -4.6), Rotator(0, 0, 0))\\n```\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/sniper-scope.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nThis is completely procedural, it also uses the 3D Mesh scope materials!\\n\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nYou can also check the [Official Weapons Package](https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-weapons), and see how a RedDot has been added to a P90!\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThat\'s it!

And with that we made several improvements, including the addition of categories in the sidebar, new tabs and even new stuff to spawn! Not to mention several bug fixes and the overall usability has been improved! No more movement blocked when opening the Spawn Menu!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/new-sandbox-ui.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## New Props \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nWe\'re importing a big pack of props that will come with the base game.\\n\\nWe\'ve been debating a lot what the threshold is between shipping the game with several props or shipping it with no props and just allowing the player to download whatever they want from the Vault. It\'s a tough decision, but for now we\'ve decided to deliver a basic pack with some cool stuff, including new **Construction Props**, **Fruits**, **Tools** and even new **Weapons**!\\n\\n![](/img/blog/sandbox-improvements/new-props.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## NPCs \ud83e\udd16\\n\\nIt\'s been in there for some time, but we\'d like to highlight it! On Spawn Menu now there is a new tab which allows spawning NPCs.\\n\\nThose NPCs has some basic functionality defined in Lua, they walk around randomly and even run away when they are threatened! Insane!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/npcs.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n## New Weapons  \ud83d\udd2b\\n\\nThis is not strictly related to Sandbox game-mode, but besides the new Props, we are shipping brand new and configured Weapons in the `nanos-world-weapons` default package!\\n\\nThis includes a P90, UMP-45, M1911 Pistol and many other!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/new-weapons.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## Weapons Pattern \ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nBesides the categories in the left-side, we are starting to add a new section to be our \\"options section\\", we started by adding a new option in the Weapons tab: **Patterns**.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/sandbox-improvements/weapon-pattern.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/sandbox-improvements/weapon-pattern-floor.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/sandbox-improvements/weapon-pattern-infernoo.jpg)\\n\\nYou can change and select any pattern from the hundreds included in the game to be applied in your weapon (it is synchronized with other players as well)! It\'s is really easy to add your own `.jpg` as pattern in the menu!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/weapons-pattern.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n## Breakable Props \ud83c\udf49\\n\\nThis is an awesome feature which I\'ve been working in the last weeks, it\'s something 100% scripting side, I\'m not sure yet if this should become a built-in thing.\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/breakable-watermelon.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nBut now on Sandbox we can configure Props to break when Hit or TakeDamage! It is also possible to easily configure which debris will be generated, it\'s randomness and much more, see an example:\\n\\n```lua\\nSetBreakableProp(\\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01\\", 700, {\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Half_01\\", rotation = Rotator() },\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Half_01\\", rotation = Rotator(180, 0, 0) },\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Crust_01\\" },\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Slice_01\\" },\\n\\t{ mesh = \\"nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Slice_01\\" },\\n})\\n```\\n\\nAnd voila every time a Watermelon spawns through the Spawn Menu, it will be breakable!\\n\\n\\n## Explosive Props \ud83d\udca5\\n\\nIn a sub-category as Breakable Props, we can have Explosive ones! Which will not only break if they take damage or get Hit, but will also EXPLODE! Causing damage, and even start a chain reaction of explosions!\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/chain-explosions.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/gas-house-explosion.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/gas-explosion-danger.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nAs you can see it can be very dangerous to play with fire! \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n\\n## What\'s next! \ud83d\udca1\\n\\nWe are currently working on making everything ready for the official Alpha 1.0.0 release! We are slowly distributing Beta Keys to some testers, this way we can calmly fix some last bugs and give the finishing touches before the full launch!\\n\\nWe\'ve also implemented a LOT of new content for modding & scripting that will still be announced in the next weeks!

So we decided to create a game from scratch, but only in mid 2019 we started working hard, it was really a very enthusiastic idea, but after a lot of blood, love and sweat we are getting there! \ud83e\udd70\\n\\n## Alpha 1.0.0!\\n\\nAnd we\'re finally reaching the long-awaited Alpha announcement! Lots of things have happened, lots of iterations have been done (and lots will come \ud83d\ude1c) and thanks to all the support from our community and your feedback, we\'re getting closer and closer to releasing nanos world!\\n\\nThe official Alpha 1.0.0 update will come with tons of scripting and gaming news!\\n\\n## Steam!\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/steam-guy.jpg)\\n\\nAlong with the Alpha announcement, we have LOTS of other surprises! As you may have noticed, now [nanos world is on STEAM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1841660/nanos_world)!!! Itch was very good and helped us a lot at the time, and we will always be grateful that their service and support has always been free! But then we made the decision to take this next step moving to the biggest game platform! \\n\\n:::tip\\n\\n\ud83c\udf8b Please don\'t forget to **WISHLIST** and share [nanos world steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1841660/nanos_world)!\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<iframe class=\\"steam-widget\\" src=\\"https://store.steampowered.com/widget/1841660/\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" width=\\"620\\" height=\\"190\\" loading=\\"lazy\\"></iframe>\\n\\n## New Website!\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/new-website.jpg)\\n\\nWe\'ve created a brand new website which contains a lot of information about nanos world which will help us marketing it! If you didn\'t yet, please take a look at [https://nanos.world](https://nanos.world)!\\n\\n## Lot of news to come!\\n\\nIn the meantime since the last update (0.73.0), we\'ve accumulated **A LOT** of new content for nanos world. Most couldn\'t be released as we were working alongside the Steam integration.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd22 Versions\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/betas.jpg)\\n\\nWith the arrival of Steam, there will be several changes to how we distribute updates! We will now have two branches `stable/latest` and `bleeding-edge`, we intend to keep the default branch as stable as possible, while working in upcoming content in the *bleeding-edge* branch.\\n\\nBy default all testers will have access to *bleeding-edge* to be able to help us testing the new features before releasing them officially! Also in the docs we are going to have two versions which represent each of the branch!\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nThe version **a1.0.0** is already present in *bleeding-edge* branch and will come to *stable* as soon as possible! Really soon we will start publishing the full changelog of that!\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### \ud83e\uddea Testers\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/manny.jpg)\\n\\nWith this new stage we decided to start fresh and restart our Tester subscriptions.
